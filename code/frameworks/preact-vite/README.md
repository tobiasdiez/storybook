### In a project with Storybook

This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7. If youâ€™re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

#### Manual migration

Install the framework:

```bash
yarn add --dev @storybook/preact-vite@next
```

Update your `main.js` to change the framework property:

export default {
  // ...
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/preact-vite', // <- Change this
    options: {},
  },
};
```
